## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete Integration

### Step 1: Start Zammad (15-20 minutes)
```bash
cd SKDsystems_customer_dash
git pull

# Update .env with Zammad config
nano .env

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Watch for Zammad initialization (takes 5-10 minutes)
docker-compose logs -f zammad-init
```

### Step 2: Complete Zammad Setup (10 minutes)
1. Open http://localhost:8080
2. Create admin account
3. Set organization name
4. Generate API token:
   - Profile → Token Access → Create
   - Name: "Dashboard Integration"
   - Permissions: admin.*
5. Add token to .env:
   ```
   ZAMMAD_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```
6. Restart dashboard:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart app
   ```

### Step 3: Add Server Routes (I'll do this next!)

Need to add to `server.js`:
```javascript
const zammadService = require('./services/zammad');

// Tickets list
app.get('/tickets', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  // Fetch and display tickets
});

// Create ticket form
app.get('/tickets/new', requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  // Show create form
});

// Create ticket
app.post('/tickets/create', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  // Create in Zammad
});

// View ticket
app.get('/tickets/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  // Show ticket details + comments
});

// Add comment
app.post('/tickets/:id/comment', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  // Add comment to ticket
});
```

### Step 4: Create Additional Views

- `views/ticket-detail.ejs` - Single ticket view with comments
- `views/ticket-form.ejs` - Create/edit ticket form

## 🎯 Features to Build

### Phase 1: Basic Ticketing (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Add ticket routes to server.js
- [ ] Create ticket detail page
- [ ] Create ticket creation form
- [ ] Test customer ticket isolation
- [ ] Link tickets to customer emails

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Add comments to tickets
- [ ] Update ticket status
- [ ] File attachments
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Dashboard ticket widget (show count on main page)

### Phase 3: Integration Polish (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Sync Zammad users with dashboard users
- [ ] Auto-create tickets from dashboard
- [ ] Link tickets to activity log
- [ ] Add ticket search
- [ ] Ticket filtering by status/priority

## 📊 Current Architecture

```
Dashboard (Port 3000)
    ↓
Zammad API Service (services/zammad.js)
    ↓
Zammad API (Port 8080)
    ↓
Zammad Database (PostgreSQL)
```

## 🎨 Design Decisions Made

1. **Zammad vs Custom**: Chose Zammad for professional features
2. **API Integration**: Dashboard communicates via Zammad REST API
3. **User Mapping**: Dashboard users linked to Zammad by email
4. **Access Control**: Customers see only their tickets via email filter
5. **UI Consistency**: Tickets page matches SKD Systems branding

## 🚀 What You Can Test Now

1. Pull latest code: `git pull`
2. Start services: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Wait for Zammad to initialize
4. Access Zammad: http://localhost:8080
5. Complete setup wizard
6. Generate API token
7. Visit dashboard tickets page: http://localhost:3000/tickets

**You should see:**
- Warning message (Zammad not configured) OR
- Ticket stats and empty table (if configured)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Clockify Integration
- Sync time entries
- Auto-calculate hours
- Link tickets to time entries
- Weekly/monthly reports

### Documentation System
- Upload markdown files
- Obsidian compatibility
- Search functionality
- Link docs to customers

### Reporting
- Customer usage reports
- Ticket analytics
- Time tracking reports
- Export to PDF/CSV

## 💡 Tips

1. **Keep Zammad URL internal**: Use `http://zammad-nginx:8080` in .env (for Docker network)
2. **External access**: Use `http://localhost:8080` in browser
3. **API Token**: Store securely, rotate regularly
4. **Backups**: Zammad data is in Docker volumes, backup regularly
5. **Updates**: Pin Zammad version in docker-compose.yml
